# SOLID Principles Overview
The SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob. The principles can help software developers design software that is easy to maintain, understand, and extend. They represent the principles of good object-oriented programming design, just as the Ten Commandments represent the principles of being a good person (well, almost). Let's explore the 5 principles with simple code examples in TypeScript.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
This principle states that a class should have only one job. In other words, if a class is in charge of doing everything, it's like a cook who also cleans the tables, manages the restaurant, and perhaps even attempts to sing in a band on weekends - far too stretched. Too many responsibilities can make the class hard to maintain and prone to errors.
Ex:
```
class BadEmployee {
  cookFood(order: Order) { /* ... */ }
  cleanTable(tableId: number) { /* ... */ }
  manageRestaurant() { /* ... */ }
  singInBand(song: string) { /* ... */ }
}

//Better, SRP-compliant version
class Cook {
  cookFood(order: Order) { /* ... */ }
}

class Janitor {
  cleanTable(tableId: number) { /* ... */ }
}

class Manager {
  manageRestaurant() { /* ... */ }
}

class Singer {
  singInBand(song: string) { /* ... */ }
}
```
## Open-Closed Principle (OCP):
This principle is about being open to extension but closed for modification. It's like when your partner tells you they love you just the way you are, but then gives you a list of things to change. It's just a way of saying, "let's add new behaviors without altering the existing ones".
Ex:
```
class BadCalculator {
  operation(operation: string, num1: number, num2: number) {
    switch (operation) {
      case 'add':
        return num1 + num2;
      case 'subtract':
        return num1 - num2;
      // Every new operation requires modifying this class. That's not good!
    }
  }
}

//Better, OCP-compliant version
interface Operation {
  execute(num1: number, num2: number): number;
}

class AddOperation implements Operation {
  execute(num1: number, num2: number): number {
    return num1 + num2;
  }
}

class SubtractOperation implements Operation {
  execute(num1: number, num2: number): number {
    return num1 - num2;
  }
}

class Calculator {
  performOperation(operation: Operation, num1: number, num2: number) {
    return operation.execute(num1, num2);
  }
}
```
## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
LSP states that objects of a superclass shall be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without breaking the application. It's like saying all your replacement workers should be able to do the job without setting the place on fire. This ensures that a subclass can always be substituted in a place where a parent class is expected.
Ex:
```
class Bird {
  fly() { /* ... */ }
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
  // Ostrich can't fly, we've got a problem here!
}

//Better, LSP-compliant version
class Bird {
}

class FlyingBird extends Bird {
  fly() { /* ... */ }
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
  // No fly method, no problem!
}
```

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) basically states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. So, if you're a vegetarian and you go to a restaurant, you don't want to have to read through all the steak and chicken dishes to find the plant-based options. Similarly, when you're coding, you don't want to have to wade through a bunch of methods you're not going to use. Interfaces should be split into smaller, more specific ones, so that the clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them.

Ex:
```
interface AllInOneKitchenAppliance {
  brewCoffee(): void;
  toastBread(): void;
  reheatPizza(): void;
  cookMeal(meal: string): void;
}

// If you're only interested in brewing coffee, you still have to implement all the methods in the interface. Overkill, isn't it?
class CoffeeMachine implements AllInOneKitchenAppliance {
  brewCoffee() { /* ... */ }
  toastBread() { throw new Error("I'm a coffee machine, I can't toast bread!") }
  reheatPizza() { throw new Error("I'm a coffee machine, I can't reheat pizza!") }
  cookMeal(meal: string) { throw new Error("I'm a coffee machine, I can't cook meals!") }
}

//Better, ISP-compliant version
interface CoffeeBrewer {
  brewCoffee(): void;
}

interface BreadToaster {
  toastBread(): void;
}

interface PizzaReheater {
  reheatPizza(): void;
}

interface MealCooker {
  cookMeal(meal: string): void;
}

// Now your coffee machine only needs to know about brewing coffee. Much better, isn't it?
class BetterCoffeeMachine implements CoffeeBrewer {
  brewCoffee() { /* ... */ }
}
```
In this revised version, we have segregated the interface AllInOneKitchenAppliance into smaller, more specific interfaces. Now, if you have a CoffeeMachine, it only needs to implement the CoffeeBrewer interface, because that's all it's interested in. The same applies to the other appliances. This approach will make your code cleaner, easier to understand, and more maintainable.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
This principle is all about reducing dependencies between the code modules. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. It's like saying "I don't need to know how electricity is produced, I just need to know how to turn on the light switch."
Here's an example for this principle:
```
class BadLightBulb {
  turnOn() { /* ... */ }
  turnOff() { /* ... */ }
}

class BadLightSwitch {
  private lightBulb: BadLightBulb;

  constructor(lightBulb: BadLightBulb) {
    this.lightBulb = lightBulb;
  }

  turnOn() {
    this.lightBulb.turnOn();
  }

  turnOff() {
    this.lightBulb.turnOff();
  }
  // This class is too tightly coupled with BadLightBulb!
}

//Better, DIP-compliant version
interface SwitchableDevice {
  turnOn(): void;
  turnOff(): void;
}

class LightBulb implements SwitchableDevice {
  turnOn() { /* ... */ }
  turnOff() { /* ... */ }
}

class LightSwitch {
  private device: SwitchableDevice;

  constructor(device: SwitchableDevice) {
    this.device = device;
  }

  turnOn() {
    this.device.turnOn();
  }

  turnOff() {
    this.device.turnOff();
  }
  // Now this class can switch on and off any device, not just a light bulb!
}
```
The SOLID principles aren't really rules, but rather principles to assist in developing practical guidelines that help us in building software that stands the test of time.
